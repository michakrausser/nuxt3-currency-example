In this example, we've defined a code block that contains JavaScript for syntax highlighting to work as intended later on.

So when we apply this to our blog post, we get:

# Sample Markdown

This is some basic, sample markdown.

## Second Heading

- Unordered lists, and:
- More

1. One
2. Two
3. Three

> Blockquote

And **bold**, _italics_.

[A link](<https://markdowntohtml.com>) to somewhere.

And code highlighting:

```js
var foo = 'bar';

function baz(s) {
  return foo + ':' + s;
}
```

The end ...
